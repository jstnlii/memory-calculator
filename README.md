# memory-calculator

This is a no-math calculator.
It uses highly complex algorithms such as if statements and return statements to calculate any basic mathematical expresion in **constant time**!!!

### How to use
Linux:  
1. download the compiled binary
2. ensure you have given it execute permissions `chmod 766 compiled.out`
3. run it as you would any executable file

Windows:  
no fucking clue lmfao

Mac:  
pre sure u can do the same as linux

### Docs
--- SUBJECT TO CHANGE ---

files:
- main
	- main.c
- functions
	- add.h
	- sub.h
	- mult.h
	- vid.h
- file generator
	- generator.py

each will contain a function that will do its intended duty (it will match the filename)

note* div.h was renamed to vid.h because of namespace issues
